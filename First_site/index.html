     <h2> Creating Public Art</h2>
     <img src=./images/mosaic.JPG alt='A mosaic which says welcome to
     shadwell'/>
     <p>Jo often facilitates workshops which develop public art object.
       Primarily working in 2D these are often paintings or mosaics. These
       works aim to give local people ownership over their neighbourhoods and
       environment, supporting the development of a collaborative voice and
       highlighing the joy and hope of people within the space. These works
       have included creation of a mosaic for Shadwell Gardens Estate and
       a mural for Fern Street Settlement.</p>

       <h2> Painting </h2>
       <img src=./images/painting.JPG alt='A painting of a girl looking at a
       dome she is holding up to the viewer'/>
       <p> Additionally, Jo has her own painting practice, working on large,
         mixed media pieces which explore emotional wellbeing in relation to
         external events and decision making. Often her paintings explore
         these themes using storytelling, colour and texture, looking at
         moments of reflection and indecision. </p>
